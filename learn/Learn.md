# For&nbsp;Teachers&nbsp;and&nbsp;Students

Our teaching and research tools use dynamic charts to present over 10 million data points from a fully transparent, open and freely available life cycle model created by EPA. Interactive data visualizations provide insights across more than 20 environmental, social and economic indicators for 389 categories of goods and services in the United States. They can be a great starting point when developing sustainability initiatives.
