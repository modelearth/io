# Bioeconomy Planner

### Purpose
The Bioeconomy Planner will be used to evaluate current and potential uses of bio-based materials
in a regional economy. The application will couple data on regional supply of virgin or reclaimed bio-based materials 
with an assortment of technologies using those materials and allow a user to select a mix of technologies and relative
percentages to perform an analysis. The technologies will include models of supply chains for the biotechnology.
 The application will provide data on costs as well as impacts of technologies on the local and total environmental profiles.

### Intended Users
- Local planners and development organizations
- Bio-based industries

### Questions to Inform
What are the best potential uses of our biomass resources in terms of use efficiency, employment, local value added,
and environmental outcomes?
